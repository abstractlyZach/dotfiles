Show off your cool desktop configuration!

"Ricing" is a [term](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3iy3wd/stupid_question_what_is_ricing/) used in a lot of [Linux circles](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) to mean "configuring your computer's software to look good". When you open this layout, you'll get to show off some basics of your system in a cool way.

This layout is intended to be a basic example of what you can do with `reZIDE`.
